# Twitch-Stream-Checker
Displays details on a number of preset streams if they are currently streaming. Has an option to show offline streams as well. Streams can be refreshed to see if any new streams are online. Search function has also been implemented. Uses the Twitch API.

Search function is super weird right now. Need to figure out a way to move the matching streams to the top. Currently just making non-matching streams invisible. They still take up space. If I try the jQuery .hide() it messes up my formatting.

Made for a FreeCodeCamp project.
